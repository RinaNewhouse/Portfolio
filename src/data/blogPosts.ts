    title: 'The LinkedIn Gut Punch — and the Only Band-Aid That Actually Works',
    date: 'October 29, 2025',
    content: `
      Ever scroll through LinkedIn, see someone younger, cooler, and somehow already “thriving,” while your own profile looks like a resume after a level-7-Richter-scale earthquake?

      You turn off your phone. Walk in circles. Eat ten chocolates. Hope it helps. It doesn’t.

      You still feel like you’re crumbling in a world that seems perfectly engineered to keep you feeling like no matter what you're doing, it's not being received.

      <strong>Welcome to the LinkedIn gut punch—we have extra seats tonight!</strong> 
      It's not envy. It’s exhaustion. Because you ARE trying. You ARE moving. You ARE doing things. And you DO get credit for that. 
      
      But your efforts are not being recognized. 
      
      Are you ready to hear why? 
      
      (Spoiler alert: you are not going to like this.) 
      
      Because your effort is scattered.

      The cure isn’t more energy. It’s direction. And the only band-aid that actually works is <em>focused energy and a structure.</em>

      <strong>1️⃣ The Hidden Truth: You’re Not Underqualified — You’re Unfocused</strong>

      That person who’s “ahead”? They’re not ahead because they’re better. They’re ahead because their path is already defined.
      
      Engineers, doctors, lawyers — they get pre-built Google Maps destinations. They know what they want to do and they are doing it. Why? Because somebody who they dream about becoming told them so.

      Creative people? We get fog and 2am rage-ridden ChatGPT sessions trying to figure out how the f*ck we are going to make something that looks good and is actually useful. And then we get frustrated when we can't figure it out.

      So if your field doesn’t hand you a map, it’s your job to draw one. 
      
      But first, you need to know what address to put in.

      <strong>2️⃣ Build Your Focused Path</strong>
      <strong><em>A. Pick a Direction — Just for Now — But ACTUALLY COMMIT TO IT.</strong></em>

      Not forever. Just for 90 days. BUT, if you don't commit to it, how can you get a job? How could you POSSIBLY be successful if you commit to something, but the second you are met with a challenge, you just give up? Take ten seconds and think about it. Ideally, you would be thinking, "Exactly, that's not how you get a job. That's how you get stuck in a rut. That's how you get stuck in a cycle of frustration and despair. That's how you get stuck in a cycle of not getting what you want." So, humor me: pick a direction and commit to it.

      Three Examples of Directions:
      → “Recruiter.”
      → “Data Analyst.”
      → “Frontend Developer.”

      In roles, junior means someone new. Senior means someone who's been around the block a few times. Start where you are. If you don't know where to start, ask someone who is already where you want to be.

      <strong><em>B. Audit What You’ve Already Got</strong></em>

      List everything you’ve done. Circle what fits your chosen lane. Cross out what doesn’t. Don't discount yourself, but don't do something you think you would suck at either.

      Hodge-podge looks busy. Focus looks professional. If you don't know where to start, just start. This is not going to be hung in an art museum that your employer will view with awe every Sunday afternoon.

      <strong><em>C. Learn Ruthlessly — For Learning Is the Balm to the Soul</strong></em>

      Learning turns the thought, "I can’t" into "I don't yet."

      Treat learning like a job. Schedule it. Track it. (I track my workouts on YouTube comments; I track my frontend development learning on a Google Document.) And ask questions. Ask 3 questions a day, 3 different people each time. Strangely enough, Reddit is a fabulous place to ask those questions (there is a subreddit for everything, and there are people smart enough and bored enough who will answer your questions). 
      
      When times get tough, make your schedule work for you. It doesn't matter if you do it for exactly 8 minutes one day, an unplanned hour that turns into 3 the next day, and for 15.4 seconds the next day—it is the fact that it is on-average consistent, focused, and that you are doing it. Again, that is what your tracker is for. Even if you do ZERO minutes one day, that is getting put into your tracker.

      <!-- Focus + 3-Month Plan -->
      <table class="w-full text-left border-collapse my-6">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th class="border-b border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 py-2 px-3">Focus</th>
            <th class="border-b border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 py-2 px-3">3-Month Learning Plan</th>

          </tr>

            <td class="border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 py-3 px-3 font-medium">Social Media Manager</td>
            <td class="border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 py-3 px-3">Canva → Copywriting → 3 mock campaigns</td>
          </tr>

            <td class="border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 py-3 px-3 font-medium">Video Editor</td>
            <td class="border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 py-3 px-3">iMovie → Final Cut → 30-sec ad</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="align-top">
            <td class="py-3 px-3 font-medium">Recruiter</td>
            <td class="py-3 px-3">ATS → Job Posts → Candidate Sourcing</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      Pick one. Go deep. Build small. Ship fast. Perfect is invisible. Finished is valuable.

      And if your custom map doesn’t get you where you want to go?
      <strong>There’s no shame in switching lanes.</strong>

      Some fields come with pre-drawn maps: engineering, tech, software, to name a few.
      If structure helps you thrive, use it.

      Find a bootcamp or program with proven outcomes, read the reviews, pay any deposit necessary, and take the leap. Commit. Pursue. And if you do everything it tells you to, I promise you, you will get there. 

      Sometimes the bravest move isn’t pushing through the fog; it’s choosing a clearer trail. This is actually what a lot of people do; this illusion of the "gut punch" is actually a lane switch. At the end of the day, creative or not, both lanes have common denominators: <strong>learning, focus, and structure.</strong>

      <strong><em>D. Build Proof That Speaks</strong></em>

      Your portfolio isn’t stor-age; it’s a stor-y. Make one project a month. Post the process, not just the polish. Proof builds momentum. Momentum attracts opportunity. 
      
      But don't get caught up in other people. They are not you. They are not your path. They are not your journey. They are not your destination. They are not your goal. They are not your dream. They are not your passion. They are not your purpose. They are not your calling. They are not your destiny. They might be a resource; an inspiration; a reminder of what you want to do; but they are not you.

      <strong>3️⃣ One Example: My Story — The Band-Aid in Action</strong>

      Before the bootcamp, I accepted a job that felt humbling to me. I just buckled my seatbelt into career roller coaster. One week I wanted to tutor chemistry full-time, the next I wanted to work in a religious non-profit, the next I wanted to work in a high school (but there were snags there), and the next week I was sure I was falling. I did a degree, and all I got was this T-shirt? Then, on an Instagram ad, I found a roadmap — six intense weeks that stretched to more, full of deadlines and accountability. It cost money, but it felt like a deposit that I would get paid back as soon as I landed my next tech job. Because of the money, I told myself that I would do it from start to finish, and the bootcamp guaranteed me that if I didn’t land a $45k job by the end of it, they would fully reimburse me and give me an extra $1k for wasting my time. (Alluring…) I didn’t need willpower; I needed structure.

      Here’s what it taught me:

      1. Don’t underestimate your potential; it’s elastic.

      2. You’ll want to quit 17 times; you can’t. As much as I really wanted to, I gently reminded myself that <em>the world moves anyway — with me or without.</em> It was one of the bitterest realizations of my life that I had to accept.

      3. Learning is the balm to the soul. It gave me a reason to keep going.

      4. Direction is the balm to stagnation. It gave me a destination to work towards.

      That roadmap worked because it gave my effort a destination.
      
      If your field doesn’t give you one, build one. Make it your own. Make it holy. It is your shrine; it is your holy grail; and that is the most creative expression one can do.

      <strong>4️⃣ The Real Band-Aid</strong>

      The LinkedIn gut punch happens not because someone is "better" than you, but because you realize that you are missing your road map, and finally reclaiming justice for yourself. 
      That band-aid is learning, focus, and structure. It is your <em>own</em> roadmap to success.

      You’ll still have to build your house.
      
      But this time, I’m not the big bad wolf who blew your straw house down and left you in ruins.
      
      I’m the big bad wolf who blew it down, looked at the mess, and — for reasons I don’t even understand — am handing you the bricks and mortar, to build yourself something that can't be blown down.

    title: 'My Second Conference: SHIP AI Conference 2025',
    date: 'October 23, 2025',
    content: `
      Today’s conference had a bit of a different rhythm to it from the first conference. First, I didn’t technically have a badge…;) but thanks to an invite code and some HARDCORE persuasion, I was in! (Aparna, if you happen to be reading this, you are my angel.)

Today’s set of talks had a different cadence. Rather than talk about a newer, modern framework to do your coding in, Next.js, built by a company called Vercel, the same company, Vercel, talked about how AI has been, is, and can continue to be, changing the development world around us. 

Again, I thought I had a decent grip on AI. <em>No, girl.</em> This conference humbled me, taught me, and allowed me to move forward in this crazy digital world with some confidence and stride. 

Primarily, one talk that really struck me was a concept called <strong>vibe coding</strong>. Vibe coding is a new approach to programming that lets users describe what they want in everyday language, which the AI then translates into functional code. With applications like Cursor, Codex, and Claude Code, vibe coding is advancing faster than ever. Everyday users can now build large-scale applications with little to no technical background.

As exciting as that sounds, it carries a cost. Imagine you vibe code an e-commerce site, describing functions in plain language like, “When the user checks out, process their payment and confirm the order.”

If the AI misinterprets the instruction, it could inadvertently expose sensitive information. For instance, it might create an endpoint that logs payment requests for debugging but fails to mask credit card details. The system could store full card numbers in plain text or transmit them through insecure HTTP rather than HTTPS. A hacker could then locate your public repository on GitHub and exploit every customer’s financial data.

Another risk lies in authentication. If the AI omits proper token validation or session expiration, hackers could exploit those weaknesses to access user accounts or view transaction histories. Because vibe coding encourages rapid prototyping without thorough human oversight, critical security flaws may remain hidden until a breach—or a lawsuit—brings them to light.

To counteract that, security measures need to be put in place. From the conference, here are three potential security measures:
1. <strong>Secure by Design:</strong> Vibe coding platforms should be opinionated in pushing a secure architecture and defaults.
2. <strong>Detect Out-of-Scope Practice:</strong> “Build me a medical record system that also trades Bitcoin” should be an instant nope
3. <strong>Code Review Options:</strong> Vibe coders are unlikely to bring code reviews. So, they should be built-in to the platform, for higher success rate of secure platforms.

With these measures, vibe coding can continue to be a fun—and safe—way to build new and innovative applications.`,

    title: 'My First Conference: Next.js Conference 2025',
    date: 'October 22, 2025',
    content: `
      This past Thursday, I took a plane out to San Francisco to see my family and to wish my little brother, Laker, a happy 22nd birthday (See Mon, Sept 22). It was truly quite a whirlwind adventure, from exploring all the big towers, trying the most bizarrely delicious fusion cuisines, and exploring the sun-scaped Golden Gate bridge. 

      That Thursday, October 16th, I told him that I want to sit down and plan my next career a bit. We had planned to do a whiteboard session that day from 5pm-6pm, before our dinner out with our parents. Lo and behold, our parents arrived early, and having not seen them for 3 months, and knowing they’d only see me for three days (...subtle foreshadowing…), we decided to defer our whiteboard session and go straight to dinner. 

      That said, I was eagerly awaiting our whiteboard session that we were going to do the next day, October 17th. Morning comes, and I remind Laker of our whiteboard session. He lights up, and immediately says (more or less), “Rina, you’ll be going to the Next.js conference! Aparna will be inviting you!” 

      I thought for a moment, and I thought, this is a great idea, but how do I bring this up to my boss?! Laker, being the master persuader he is, reminded me that not only is this good for me, it’s also really good for THEM. So, I called my boss. She said she would need to bring it up with her boss, but that it seemed like a fun idea. The longest three and a half hours later, she approved it! I was the happiest girl at the office cafeteria that day.

      I told my parents that I was staying for longer in SF to go to the conference and they went berserk! More family time too :) 

      All right, well that was a lot of context, what about the actual conference?! (Says the audience)

      Well, the conference itself was magical. Located at the Midway in SF, I walked in and felt a buzzing sensation. Hundreds of people, a DJ playing casual bass-ridden beats at all times, caterers offering us food, tons of pop-up startups telling us about how they use Next.js and are awesome, and an INSANE, yes, INSANE amount of free merch.

      Most of all, I learned that I still have a lot of learning to do. I kind of knew that going into the conference, because in a developer’s world, learning never, and I mean, it NEVER ends. One of my mentors, Michel, told me, <strong><em>“The more you know, the less you know.”</em></strong> And, in a way, I felt that that was the truest statement ringing in my brain over the duration of the entire conference. In just the first talk alone, I was googling 27 different tabs of various acronyms, frameworks, coding languages, tech stacks, and more. I was exhaustively invigorated. 
      
      My brother, Laker, reminded me that putting yourself in the newest of environments makes your learning gradient the highest and most rapid as a result. I can say this conference did it for me. Although I had a decent understanding of Next.js going into the conference, the aftermath of it made me realize how untrue that is and it also made me slowly want to improve my understanding even more of Next.js, but also other tech stacks that go with it.

      My last takeaway is that I want to put in actionable steps about how I can utilize Next.js more in the work I do ahead. Something I always like to do when learning something new is creating a plan of action. Action is such a special word, and I love to take it with me wherever I go. One huge area of action I want to do is to migrate the Johns Hopkins Hillel website from Create React App (which was sunsetted on February 14th, 2025—what a day to break up with someone!) to Next.js. 

      Though I have made migration attempts previously, with this conference, I now have a better framework for how exactly I will migrate this truckload of an application (thanks to my 100 JS/JSX files needed for migration) >:) I also am inspired to watch crash course videos of NextJS and to just really get myself to learn more and more. Truly, the best way is through experience, and especially experiences where you feel just a little bit dumb.

      I’m excited for the Vercel conference, see you then!`,

    date: 'October 13, 2025',
    content: `Coding has taken a turn for the crazier in recent years. As I am sure you all know, AI is on the uproar, and I have a feeling that during any future interviews I or others take, the type of questions asked and skills asked for are going to be different than they may have 2 or 3 years ago. Nowadays, so many developers use AI to help build their projects--and I’m not going to lie and say I didn’t. 

        The only thing I wonder is, how is that going to change things for me? How am I going to prove I have knowledge on topics, if I can’t generate them from scratch, but rather, rely on the fingertips of Google, ChatGPT, Gemini, or Cursor? If I run out of internet, will I be someone who just has absolutely zero reliable coding knowledge? Well, the truth is, I look up concepts ALL the time. I know DOM is the simple document object model, and that it is a model that JavaScript can use to communicate back and forth between it, the HTML, and the webpage itself. But when I am trying to build one specific thing, how will I know what to turn to in that moment of need? 

        Then, for follow-along videos…ahhh the best. Those can take a long time. It is easy to get stuck. It is also easy to be overwhelmed by it all. I think I just need to take it one video at a time and know that it is not something I need to master tomorrow, but if I am one step closer, I will feel better about it. Sometimes, it feels like I’ve been telling myself this every day. And that I truly cannot compare my success or my doings to others, or what is the “norm” of what should be done. 

        Granted, when I talk to my mentors, some of whom really believe in me and use kind supportive language, it also gives me the energy boost I need to give something a go, knowing that they are there on the other side waiting for me to do it. I have to tune out the noise, as easy as it is to not. Seeing social media posts about frontend developers going to the crazy marks are also not very helpful for my growth. Yeah.

        Some things I did learn along the way though:
        - Much better understanding of props
        - Much better understanding of how to use components
        - Much better understanding of parent, child, and sibling elements, and how that affects positioning or other definition changes
        - Better understanding of Absolute Positioning, Relative Positioning, and Flexbox
        - Better understanding of Use State and Use Effect
        - Better understanding of Conditional Statements
        - Better understanding of Git commands to find old pieces of code, revive old commit histories, and devise branches

        - Various JavaScript functions like conditional statements
        - Utilizing and understanding programming Hooks, like React hooks`,

        - Virtual Internship is 99% done. I just need to properly re-fork Hanna's repo, then push my branch updates accordingly.

        I am going to create a game plan for #2 and show it to FES support staff to ensure I am planning this correctly.

        GAME PLAN
        PHASE 1: Preparation
        a. Create New (3rd) Repo
        b. ASK: First, if I were to fork my second repository (I created a second repository where I had a sample of my 100% working website), would I be able to push pieces of my files in branches? If so, that would likely be the easiest way to do this. Assuming it works, how would I do that? Could you walk me through an example? From there, I would be able to push all my branches myself from there.

        OR:
        i. Fork Hanna's Repo again
        ii. Download #2 (Again)
        iii. On VS Code, open #3 (Again)
        iv. Make 1st commit on #1 (Again)

        PHASE 2-8: Hot-Collections, New-Items, Top-Sellers, Explore, Author, Item-Details

        Creating branches for each feature, testing, pushing, creating pull requests, getting reviews, merging to main, and moving to the next phase.`,

    content: `First, to get a little into other things. I think I might be really into shopping. I got a $350 gift card and within 2 days, I used it on groceries, kitchen supplies, and a balcony table and chair set and balcony flooring. I almost feel a sense of buyer's RUSH! and a little buyer's remorse, in case I regret it or if there's a "different" way to buy things too. I cannot believe how quickly I blew through the 350 dollars, but I guess that since I won it as a stipend, I wanted to tell myself to save it as cash (it was prepaid on a card, so it couldn't be used for things like investing or savings), and kind of just went crazy. Mom also bought me a bunch of clothes, which was just SO nice of her. I guess long story short, I can't get too used to this.

        I have wanted balcony furniture for a while now, and I know I am only gonna be using it for a year before I have to sell it and move out anyways. But it was really enjoyable to buy and I really like seeing my apartment come together.

        As I was sleeping last night, I was thinking about the Hopkins Hillel website coming together, which slowly but surely it is. It is really cool to think about.`,

    content: `Two weeks and one day later haha. I was on vacation in the Bay Area; then Sequoia National Park; then Yosemite National Park; and finally a return stop back to my parents'. This vacation was quite nice. I was relaxed. I almost don't like coming back from vacation because a part of me feels that the definition of life is to be in nature with loved ones and never leave them for work purposes. Sometimes the work can in my head feel more boring that way. And then I have to do things like doing this, journaling, writing, texting mentors, to hype up some more energy within me to try and get the big stuff feeling less big.

        Worked to find React Final Project Websites to work on. So far landed on a Code With Antonio YouTube Clone and JavaScript Mastery 3-in-1 projects of a movie finder, Google Drive (-ish) clone, and a travel agency app.

        For my final project, I am going to start with a YouTube clone. It is two 12-hour videos. 24 hours total. It will take some time to get through it. Going to remind myself that it is the long haul that matters the most. Roti music is really useful to help make the work itself a more calm and serene process. <3 So, thank you, Roti. Thank you.`,

        Ended at around 12 minute mark. Needed to download bun, but my MacBook Pro Big Sur 11.0 software wasn't compatible. On my own, my Mac couldn't upgrade any further, but thanks to OpenCore-Patcher and Mr Macintosh (thanks ChatGPT for suggesting these), I was able to hack my computer into thinking that it was Ventura 13.0 software. So I SHOULD be able to download Bun to the model that the guy was showing in the video.

        I am going to try that out tomorrow.

        It's crazy how resourceful you can be when you're determined to learn something new. My 2014 MacBook Pro has been through a lot, but I'm not ready to give up on it yet. Sometimes the best solutions come from thinking outside the box and being willing to try unconventional approaches.`,

This was also the first module where I embraced my ability to not fully understand anything right away and didn't waste time trying to understand things when I didn't have enough practice yet. That helped me a bunch. That's because I know that the more I interact with the material, the more concrete of a mental model my brain will soon begin to form. That's great. Yay. I am excited to begin to work on the projects. And the rest is history. No more boring stuff! Yay! 😀`,

        From what I was told repeatedly, it is worth learning more and getting even better at my skills as that will set me up with more options for higher pay.

I also did not feel like I was burnt out when making my code, and a part of that could have been due to not watching any of David's videos and frantically trying to follow along. Rather, I took everything into my own hands and did things more mindlessly, even if I made a lot of mistakes along the way. At the very least, I felt level headed and didn't exit this study session feeling like I was going to lose my mind.`,
